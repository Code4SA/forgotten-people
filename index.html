        This is the story of thousands of people, who have been living in dire poverty for years, “forgotten” by the authorities because they are missing from census data. An investigation conducted by Code4SA Data Journalism Academy, based on data acquired from several sources has revealed that there are 97 informal settlements that were never counted in the last census conducted in 2011. In these settlements live thousands of “forgotten” people. NOLOYISO MTEMBU AND LAILAH RYKLIEF report:

They stand on a strip of land across the road from streets of RDP houses with fences and neat gardens.
        Although Nyakathisa is home to hundreds of people, there are only six communal toilets in the settlement, which are kept locked by a small group of shack dwellers who use them. They were built in 2013 and shared by 18 households - so the remaining households have no access to a toilets.</span></p>

Back then, Nyakathisa comprised of a handful of shacks but it has kept on growing over the years as more and more families desperate for somewhere to live, moved into the area.
            It is a place of desperation inhabited by &rdquo;forgotten&rdquo; people who eke out their lives on the margins of society.

            A census is a tool that governments use to count their population and to assess what services they have access to, or what they need. Yet data acquired from several sources has revealed that there are 97 informal settlements that were never counted in the last census held in 2011. In them live thousands of “forgotten” people. According to Statistics South Africa: "For many people, the census may be the only time that the state reaches them and asks them a question."<br>
            Nyakathisa is one of 97 informal settlements whose residents were never counted in the 2011 Census, an essential government tool to help budget and plan for developments and services. The 2011 Census, conducted by Statistics South Africa, counted 216 informal settlements in the Cape Metro, then home to 570 035 people.
            But, using toilet facilities collected by the City of Cape Town, Weekend Argus has found that 97 informal settlements in the metro were never counted during the Census. In some cases these settlements are made up of shacks that have mushroomed on empty pieces of land between houses in built up areas.
            Additional satellite data from Geoterraimage highlighted the rapid growth of informal settlements around Cape Town, with 23 new ones springing up between the Census 2011 and 2013.

            The dozens of shacks that make up Nyakathisa are tightly packed on a strip of ground across the road from brick RDP houses, with neat, fenced in gardens and tarred roads running past them. The people in the houses say that their health is affected by the squalid and unhealthy living conditions of their neighbours.
            Fearful of the devastation that fire could wreak if it swept through their settlement, the shack dwellers have hooked up illegal electrical connections to their neighbours in the RDP houses, paying a fee that is determined by the house owners.
            “Until recently Nyakathisa had no water or toilets. They used our water, and our bills were very high,” says Thembakazi Banjwa, another Nyakathisa resident. “They still do not have electricity, hence you see illegal connection. A lot of us lived there until some people, including myself, moved into these RDP houses in 2008,” she said.

              Nyakathisa was meant to be a temporary settlement while the RDP houses were being built, and, as more houses were built, the settlement was meant to have ceased to exist, Banjwa said.
              For Gocina and many other residents, every year that passed presented hope that their turn would come to move to better housing.
              “There were about 30 shacks here when I came, but the settlement has grown since then. I do not remember anyone doing census here in 2011,” he said.  It was only when the Weekend Argus visited the settlement that Gocina learned that his settlement was not counted in the Census in 2011. He was shocked.
              “This is painful because we have been hopeful that we are being considered, especially for houses and electricity. It seems no one even knows we exist, yet we have been voting,” he said shaking his head. Like many other Nyakathisa residents, Gocina said they seldom saw the area’s ward councillor, Themba Honono of the ANC.
              “We sometimes hear that he is visiting Bardale or other sections but we have never met him here,” the resident said. Honono failed to respond to a request for comment.

              Statistics South Africa spokesman Trevor Oosterwyk denied that some informal settlements were not included in the 2011 count. “The City of Cape Town is 100 percent covered with enumeration areas (EAs). Unless an EA was not enumerated, all people were enumerated,” Oosterwyk said. Asked about Cape Town settlements which were not reflected in the Census, he said: “The fact that we do not have these names as sub-places does not mean the areas were not enumerated. No omissions were made,” he said.

              But he admitted that some people could have been left out because they were not in their homes when the enumerators visited their areas. “People who work in places far away from home and, thus leave very early in the morning and return late in the evening were difficult to enumerate. Enumerators only worked between 8am and 7pm and there would be people who leave their homes at 5am and return after 8pm for instance. In most cases this was mitigated by making suitable appointments with people to be counted,” he said. But Gocina and others insist, there were no enumerators in Nyakathisa in 2011.

            <em>Residents of Nyakathisa say they were not counted in the Statistics South Africa 2011 Census, and the first time they were counted was in 2015, by the municipality. These residents use sand dunes as their toilets as there are only six toilets in the settlement, and only 18 families have access to these.</em>

              The dozens of shacks that make up Nyakathisa are tightly packed on a strip of ground across the road from brick RDP houses, with neat, fenced in gardens and tarred roads running past them. The people in the houses say that their health is affected by the squalid and unhealthy living conditions of their neighbours.
              Fearful of the devastation that fire could wreak if it swept through their settlement, the shack dwellers have hooked up illegal electrical connections to their neighbours in the RDP houses, paying a fee that is determined by the house owners.
              “Until recently Nyakathisa had no water or toilets. They used our water, and our bills were very high,” says Thembakazi Banjwa, another Nyakathisa resident. “They still do not have electricity, hence you see illegal connection. A lot of us lived there until some people, including myself, moved into these RDP houses in 2008,” she said.

                Nyakathisa was meant to be a temporary settlement while the RDP houses were being built, and, as more houses were built, the settlement was meant to have ceased to exist, Banjwa said.
                For Gocina and many other residents, every year that passed presented hope that their turn would come to move to better housing.
                “There were about 30 shacks here when I came, but the settlement has grown since then. I do not remember anyone doing census here in 2011,” he said.  It was only when the Weekend Argus visited the settlement that Gocina learned that his settlement was not counted in the Census in 2011. He was shocked.
                “This is painful because we have been hopeful that we are being considered, especially for houses and electricity. It seems no one even knows we exist, yet we have been voting,” he said shaking his head. Like many other Nyakathisa residents, Gocina said they seldom saw the area’s ward councillor, Themba Honono of the ANC.
                “We sometimes hear that he is visiting Bardale or other sections but we have never met him here,” the resident said. Honono failed to respond to a request for comment.

                Statistics South Africa spokesman Trevor Oosterwyk denied that some informal settlements were not included in the 2011 count. “The City of Cape Town is 100 percent covered with enumeration areas (EAs). Unless an EA was not enumerated, all people were enumerated,” Oosterwyk said. Asked about Cape Town settlements which were not reflected in the Census, he said: “The fact that we do not have these names as sub-places does not mean the areas were not enumerated. No omissions were made,” he said.

                But he admitted that some people could have been left out because they were not in their homes when the enumerators visited their areas. “People who work in places far away from home and, thus leave very early in the morning and return late in the evening were difficult to enumerate. Enumerators only worked between 8am and 7pm and there would be people who leave their homes at 5am and return after 8pm for instance. In most cases this was mitigated by making suitable appointments with people to be counted,” he said. But Gocina and others insist, there were no enumerators in Nyakathisa in 2011.
